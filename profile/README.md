xarray-contrib is a GitHub organization for gathering high-quality open source projects that build on [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/).

Here's a short list of actively developed and widely used packages in the org:

- [xskillscore](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xskillscore) - Metrics for verifying forecasts
